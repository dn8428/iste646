									My students love MasterMinds. I rarely get through the first
									day of school without a returning student asking “When do we
									start practice?” The kids like the program because it is fun
									and they enjoy competing against other schools. The questions
									are balanced so the different students can shine in different
									topics. It encourages teamwork and sportsmanship. I like the
									program because it celebrates academics and encourages
									students to be proud of their knowledge. The other reason I
									like it is over the years I have had many students get
									involved in MasterMinds that were not in any other club or
									activity at the school. It gives them someplace to fit in and
									find new friends. It has been great to watch these kids
									blossom in this environment. Win or lose they always have
									fun.</q>

								<q>My ten years of coaching the MasterMinds teams at

								<q>I graduated from Nardin Academy in 2005 as the VP of our Quiz
									Bowl club. Jeopardy! happened to jog my memory/curiosity last
									night, so I went looking for the MasterMinds site. I was
									thrilled to find it still alive and well-updated...complete
									with archives! I got to relive our crushing playoff defeat
									from my senior year, haha. Truly though, I thoroughly enjoyed
									all of my time in MasterMinds, and it prepared me well for
									NAQT competitions in college. Since high school, I've come
									across a fair number of former MasterMinds participants from
									various regions. Upon discovering the MasterMinds connection,
									the conversation unfailingly goes the same way: people get all
									excited to meet a fellow trivia nerd. I just loved MasterMinds
									completely, and it's terrific to see all the teams of kids
									across the state still loving it the same way I did.</q>

								<q>Becoming a part of MasterMinds was the best decision I made
									throughout my four years of high school. As a freshman, I
									didn't know anybody in the club and I was anxious to join. I
									felt welcomed as soon as I stepped through the door. I was not
									only welcomed during practices at my school, but at matches at
									other schools and by everybody involved with running
									MasterMinds. I started paying attention to seemingly
									"meaningless" details in class, trying to absorb as much as I
									could for MasterMinds. When I had a practice or match to look
									forward to, I dragged myself out of bed quicker, rushed to get
									ready for school, and was more cheerful throughout the day.
									Most importantly, I met one of my favorite teachers and some
									of my closest friends as a result of MasterMinds. I will
									always cherish the memories we made playing Trivial Pursuit
									and thinking up random solutions to bonus question.
									MasterMinds was easily my favorite part of high school.</q>

								<q>MasterMinds was a great way for me to get into trivia in a
									competitive setting and was one of the most fun I've had in
									clubs in high school. When you and your three teammates are up
									on the buzzers, you just feel the camaraderie and the team
									aspect is really what makes the game more fun. If you love
									trivia, you will love MasterMinds. It's also a great place to
									not only strengthen friendships but also make new ones by
									meeting players from all around your region. Also getting the
									question right off the bat for a fresh 15 points is possibly
									one of the best feelings in the world.</q>

								<q>The MasterMinds program was a bit of a life changer for me.
									At 16 I had heard quite a bit about this “Jeopardy for teams”
									through other members of my cross country team, and loathe for
									the season to end I jumped at the chance to join. The friends
									I made within the program, both within my own school and from
									those we played against, undeniably became my closest for the
									remainder of my high school years. I am still in contact with
									a few, and would not give up the experience I had for any

								<q>I remember when I first joined MasterMinds, I was too shy to
									buzz in even during after-school practice. When I finally
									mustered up the courage to buzz in during a match against
									another school, I literally tasted adrenaline. It may seem odd
									to think of MasterMinds as intense or exhilarating, but that's
									how it was for me, and I became hooked. While I grew
									accustomed to the "spotlight" of the buzzer, it was always a
									rush for me to nail an early powermark or carry a bonus
									question for my team. Eventually I became one of the strongest
									players in my league, and I still feel pride when I consider
									how much I grew over my 4 years in MasterMinds.</q>

									being the president and captain of our team for two years.
									Additionally, MasterMinds introduced me to some of my closest

								<h2>History:</h2>
							<p>
								MasterMinds began with twenty five schools in Rochester in 1993,
								expanding into the Buffalo area in 1995. A junior varsity
								component was added in 1997. MasterMinds was first offered in the
								Albany/ Capital District and Syracuse regions in 1999 and 2004
								respectively.
							</p>
							<p>
								CYPRAS started MasterMinds in the fall of 1993 in the Rochester
								area with 25 schools. In the fall of 1995, MasterMinds became a
								BOCES offering and the program expanded into the Buffalo region.
								Forty-eight schools participated in 1995-96. Fifty-two schools
								participated in the 1996-97 season. A junior varsity option was
								made available in 1997-98 with 13 of the 61 schools fielding both
								varsJVity and teams. In 1999-2000, MasterMinds expanded into the
								Albany/Capital Distict area and participation topped 70 schools.
								In 2003-2004, MasterMinds was introduced into the Syracuse area
								and total participation crested 100 schools for the first time.

								MasterMinds is a fast-paced question-and-answer academic
								competition that tests the depth and breadth of students'
								knowledge in subjects such as history, literature, science,
								politics, art, geography, religion, sports & current events.
							</p>
							<p>
								With more than a hundred participating schools there are over one
								thousand students involved, and those numbers continue to grow
								each year throughout New York State.
							</p>

								<h2>Organization</h2>
								<p>
									The organization of MasterMinds is fairly unique. In some areas,
									MasterMinds is a BOCES service available to public schools through
									a BOCES center. Private schools, depending on the region, sign up
									through BOCES or CYPRAS. CYPRAS, a non-profit company which
									established the MasterMinds program, organizes and administers the
									program.
								</p>
								<p>
									In each region, a preseason scheduling meeting is held to organize
									schools into leagues, and the dates and sites of the meets are
									established. Normally, the twelve game regular season is divided
									into six meets held during the school year from mid October -
									April. Customization of the schedule is also available.
								</p>
								<p>
									The top teams in each league advance to regional playoffs in late
									April with state playoffs in late May/early June.
								</p>

								<h2>How is itplayed?</h2>
								<p>
								MasterMinds uses a form of the NAQT™ Quiz Bowl format for match

							<h2>Master minds Rules</h2>
							<p>
								In each region, schools are arranged into different leagues at the
								start of the school year, playing a 12 game regular season with
								the top schools advancing to double elimination playoffs.
								MasterMinds has divided the state into eight regions: Buffalo
								(Section VI), Rochester/Genesee Valley (Section V),
								Syracuse/Watertown/Utica/Rome (Section III), Binghamton/Southern
								Tier (Section IV), Albany/Capital District (Section II),
								Adirondacks/North Country (Section VII and X),
								Catskills/Westchester (Sections 1 and IX), and Long Island
								(Sections VIII and XI). State tournament play began with the
								2005-2006 season.
							</p>
							<h2>Who can play?</h2>
							<p>
								All public, private, charter and parochial high schools are
								eligible. Any student from those schools may play. Seventh and
								eighth graders may be allowed to participate in leagues upon
								approval of a majority of coaches within that league. There are no
								scholastic requirements other than those established by individual
								districts for their own students.
							</p>
							<h2>When & Where to play?</h2>
							<p>
								Meets are held after school with each league gathering once every
								few weeks. Meets are held over the course of the school year with
								the regular season running from approximately mid- to late October
								through to early April, followed by playoffs. Each meet is
								normally designed so that each school plays two matches. Meets are
								held in the high schools with the location rotating among the
								participants with the actual days, starting times and places
								scheduled at the start of the year. Each meet consists of four to
								eight matches, generally beginning between 3:15 and 3:30 with the
								final match ending between 5:30 and 6:30, possibly later on select
								occasions. If all participants agree, meets can be held in neutral
								locations and scheduled at other times.
							</p>
							<h2>Topics covered</h2>
							<p>
								The questions cover a broad range: art, biology, chemistry,
								current events, geography, history, literature, music, political
								science, pop culture, religion and sports. Sample questions can be
								viewed
								<a href="www.naqt.com/samples/introductory-invitational-series.pdf">Here</a>
							</p>
							<h2>How many student make up a team?</h2>
							<p>
								A team plays four students at a time and has the opportunity to
								substitute as many as all four at the half, so eight different
								students could play in a single game. Schools have generally
								averaged 9 students per team if they have a junior varsity
								program. Schools without a JV program tend to average a bit more.
							</p>
							<h2>How time-consuming is MasterMinds for the advisor/coach?</h2>
							<p>
								It’s difficult to say since the only true coaching requirement is
								to chaperone the team during meets. This chaperone does not have
								to be the same person and the duty can rotate among several
								people. It is, however, important to have a single contact person
								for communications, arranging transportation and getting students
								practice questions. Even if one person handles those duties,
								MasterMinds is not very time-consuming. Many coaches hold weekly
								practices or hold practices the week immediately prior to a
								scheduled meet.
							</p>
							<h2>How time-consuming is MasterMinds for students?</h2>
							<p>
								Since meets are held roughly once every three weeks, even a varsity
								athlete can participate as long as MasterMinds meets do not
								conflict with athletic games and the athletic coach is agreeable.
							</p>
							<h2>Player recruitement players.</h2>
							<p>
								Coaches ask teachers from the various disciplines who some of
								their better students are and then supplement that group with
								anyone who responds to a morning announcement recruiting people
								who enjoy Trivial Pursuit and Jeopardy. Word of mouth will do the
								rest.
							</p>
							<h2>How do schools practice and how often?</h2>
							<p>
								Schools are given practice questions at the start of the year.
								Some coaches do set aside some practice questions and run a ‘real’
								game complete with recognizing, ringing-in and the like. Others
								have students read the questions to each other to improve their
								listening skills while freeing the coach/advisor to do other
								things. The students can practice the listening drills whenever.
								Coaches should also make sure they do their homework and read the
								newspaper.
							</p>
							<h2>Why should schools participate?</h2>
							<p>
								It is fun for students and adults. It is an activity that is more
								educational and intellectual than sports. It provides students,
								particularly the non-athletically inclined, with a meaningful
								opportunity to represent their school in an interscholastic
								setting. There is not enough attention paid to academic
								extra-curriculars, especially compared to athletics. MasterMinds
								attempts to fill an extracurricular void on the academic side of
								school.

							<h2>Partnership</h2>

								<h2>Rochester Chess Center</h2>
								<p>
									In the fall of 1998, the MasterMinds program and Rochester
									Interscholastic Chess League program, sponsored by the Rochester
									Chess Center embarked on a new cooperative venture: coordinating
									the scheduling of meets so that both Chess and MasterMinds were
									scheduled on the same dates, in the same places. This coordination
									allows schools the option of combining the transportation budgets
									for both teams, reducing a significant program cost for many
									schools. Schools that determine that there is significant student
									participation overlap between the two teams do have the option of
									scheduling their teams in separate leagues and traveling
									separately. Though designed primarily for rural schools with
									longer transportation runs, both rural, suburban and urban/city
									schools have all taken advantage of this new opportunity.
									Participation in the Interscholastic Chess League almost tripled
									in just two years and some schools that only played Chess have
									added MasterMinds for their students. In the 2003-2004 season,
									this same format of coordinated scheduling began for schools in
									the Buffalo region. Plans for continued expansion into other
									regions are underway. For more information about MasterMinds and
									Chess, you can call Ron Lohrman, director of the Interscholastic
									Chess Leagues, at (585) 442-2430, or MasterMinds Commissioner
									Scott Kroner at (585) 473-0864.
